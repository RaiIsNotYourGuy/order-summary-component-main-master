### What I learned

SVGs work differently compared to traditional image formats. To help scale the SVG to the card, I had to remove the height and width and add a viewBox with the matching width/height.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I will attempt to gain more knowledge on how SVGs and Flexbox work.

### Useful resources

I do not remember what source I used to help with the SVG issue, but I am sure it was on stackoverflow.
